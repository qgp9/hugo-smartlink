# AI Development Collaboration Rules

## Purpose

This document defines the rules and guidelines for effective collaboration between developers and AI coding assistants, ensuring development continuity and quality.

## Core Development Rules

### Documentation Maintenance
1. **Update Frequency**: Update documentation at meaningful development milestones
2. **Pre-Commit Requirement**: **MUST** update documentation before any commit
3. **Language**: All development documentation must be written in English
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include code characteristics, progress status, next steps, and important notes

### AI Assistant Collaboration
5. **Pair Programming**: AI coding assistants work in collaboration with developers
6. **Session Continuity**: Document important collaboration points for future sessions
7. **Commit Suggestions**: AI assistants can suggest commits at meaningful development units
8. **Developer Focus Support**: Assist developers who may miss commit timing while focused on problem-solving

### Documentation Standards
9. **Self-Contained**: Documentation should be understandable with only commit logs and code
10. **Meaningful Units**: Update at appropriate development milestones
11. **Context Preservation**: Capture code nature, progress, next steps, and important considerations

### Content Flexibility
12. **Development/Cooperation Enhancement**: Content that promotes development and collaboration can be added regardless of current format
13. **Format Freedom**: When adding content for development/cooperation enhancement, format restrictions can be ignored
14. **Dynamic Updates**: Rules and guidelines can be updated as collaboration patterns evolve

## Communication Guidelines

### Language Usage
- **Development Documentation**: English (for global accessibility)
- **Developer-AI Conversation**: Korean (unless specific instruction states otherwise)
- **Code Comments**: English (when needed)

### Collaboration Principles
- **Context Preservation**: Always maintain development context across sessions
- **Proactive Documentation**: Document important decisions and rationale
- **Progress Tracking**: Regular updates on development status and next steps
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure comprehensive testing and documentation

## File Structure

### `.ai-rules.md` (This file)
- **Purpose**: AI collaboration rules and guidelines
- **Content**: Stable rules and collaboration standards
- **Update Frequency**: When collaboration patterns change

### `.ai-dev-context.md`
- **Purpose**: Current project development context
- **Content**: Dynamic project status, progress, and technical details
- **Update Frequency**: At meaningful development milestones

## Quality Standards

### Before Committing
1. ✅ Update `.ai-dev-context.md` file
2. ✅ Ensure tests pass (`make test`)
3. ✅ Update README.md if needed
4. ✅ Review configuration examples
5. ✅ Commit with meaningful message

### AI Assistant Responsibilities
- **Context Preservation**: Document important decisions and rationale
- **Progress Tracking**: Update status and next steps regularly
- **Collaboration Notes**: Record important pair programming insights
- **Commit Suggestions**: Propose commits at logical development milestones
